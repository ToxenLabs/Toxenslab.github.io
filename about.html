          <p>These NFTs are all about the collection of different members of a secret organization called the “Mafia of Kytas”. It is one of the most dangerous 
          organizations in the world. </p>

          <p>It currently consists of 70 members.</p>
          
          It keeps on growing bigger and bigger day by day. No one yet realizes that they make a huge amount of money with certain chores that are illegal. 
          It was founded based on friendship and a promise was made that all the members would care for each other during tough times. 
          But, eventually, in war ideals can be corrupted, and thus, that promise was not held and was broken.</p>
          <p>
          The organization was founded in Shinjuku, Japan. The organization is in such a position right now due to its leading member and
           the President “Kyta”. </p>
          <p>
          He was also the founder. He too was ignored by many people around him as they thought that he was a worthless person. 
          Then he thought of helping people just like him who had no friends and were alone. He then made friends and called the group “The Kytas”.
           As time passed and due to the ignorance that people showed him, his mind was filled with sadness and anger
            and it became wild and he thought of doing some chores which would earn him Millions. 
           That’s when he renamed his group as “Mafia of Kytas” and became its President.</p>
          <p>
          Now, be a part of this organization which is a ride filled with struggles, pain, and difficulties but is filled with
           the atmosphere of love and brotherhood which is also called “Life”.</p>
